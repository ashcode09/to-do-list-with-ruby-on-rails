# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

Note for future Heroku deployments, used 'heroku config:set PG_UN=pgpassword' to set PG_UN to postgres username, and PG_PW to postgres password.
